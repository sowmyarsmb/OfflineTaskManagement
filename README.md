# Task Management App - README

## Project Overview
This is a task management application built using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern in Kotlin. It provides features such as task management, categorization, due dates, priority levels, and search functionality. The app uses Room for local database storage and follows Material Design principles for a modern and responsive UI.

## Project Setup

### Development Environment
- **IDE**: Android Studio
- **Programming Language**: Kotlin
- **Architecture Pattern**: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
- **Database**: Room

## Architecture
The application follows the MVVM architecture, which separates the app's data and business logic from the UI, making the codebase more modular and easier to manage.

### Components
1. **Model**: Represents the data and business logic. This includes the Room database, entities, and DAOs.
2. **View**: The UI layer, built using XML and Kotlin. It includes activities and fragments.
3. **ViewModel**: Acts as a bridge between the Model and View layers. It holds the app's data and business logic and prepares it for the UI.

## User Interface
- **Design Principles**: Follows Material Design guidelines for a modern and responsive UI.
- **Layout**: Uses ConstraintLayout for flexible and responsive designs.
- **Animations**: Custom animations and transitions are implemented for a smooth user experience.

## Core Features

### Task Management
- **Create, Edit, Delete Tasks**: Users can create, edit, and delete tasks.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed**: Users can mark tasks as completed.

### Categorization
- **Tags/Folders**: Users can categorize tasks using tags or folders.

### Due Dates
- **Set Due Dates**: Users can set due dates and times for tasks.

### Priority Levels
- **Assign Priority Levels**: Users can assign priority levels to tasks (e.g., low, medium, high).

### Search Functionality
- **Search Tasks**: Users can search for tasks by content or tags.

## Local Database

### Room Database
- **Entities**: Represents tables in the database.
  - **Task**: Stores task details.
  - **Category**: Stores task categories.
- **DAOs**: Data Access Objects to manage database operations.
  - **TaskDao**: Manages task-related database operations.
  - **CategoryDao**: Manages category-related database operations.

### Database Schema
- **Task Table**: Stores task information including ID, title, description, due date, priority level, and completion status.
- **Category Table**: Stores category information including ID and name.

### Data Access Objects (DAOs)
- **TaskDao**: Provides methods to insert, update, delete, and query tasks.
- **CategoryDao**: Provides methods to insert, update, delete, and query categories.

## Setup Instructions
